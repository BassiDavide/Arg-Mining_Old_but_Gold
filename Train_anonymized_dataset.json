          "CommentText": "User_068  Please consider the following summary of perspectives on the southern U.S. border over time. As you do, it ought to become clear that the problem didn't arise from anything that happened two years ago.\n\nConcerns about border security along the U.S.-Mexico boundary have deep historical roots, shaped by a variety of factors including economic interests, geopolitical changes, and social dynamics. Here's a broad overview of the evolution of U.S. concerns related to the southern border:\n\n1. **Post-Mexican-American War (1848)**: After the U.S. annexed large portions of Mexican territory as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, defining and maintaining the new border became an issue. However, the concerns at this time were more about demarcation and establishing sovereign control than about immigration or security as we understand it today.\n\n2. **Late 19th Century**: The introduction of a railroad system that connected U.S. and Mexican markets brought increased cross-border movement of goods and people. This period saw increased monitoring but was still relatively open, and the focus was more on economic opportunity than security.\n\n3. **Early 20th Century and the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920)**: The violence and instability resulting from the Mexican Revolution led to significant numbers of refugees and migrants heading north. This heightened awareness about the southern border, leading to increased U.S. military presence there. It was during this period that the U.S. started formalizing border controls.\n\n4. **U.S. Prohibition Era (1920-1933)**: Prohibition laws in the U.S. led to an increase in smuggling of alcoholic beverages from Mexico. This spurred concerns about illicit cross-border activities.\n\n5. **1930s - World War II Era**: The economic hardships of the Great Depression saw a shift in U.S. policy, with efforts to repatriate many Mexican workers. During World War II, however, labor shortages led to the Bracero Program (1942-1964), which allowed Mexican laborers to work in the U.S. on a temporary basis.\n\n6. **1960s-1980s**: As economic disparities between the U.S. and Mexico grew and political instability and conflict escalated in Central America, illegal immigration became a more pressing concern. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which imposed numerical quotas on countries, and the end of the Bracero Program both had significant impacts on immigration patterns and increased illegal entries.\n\n7. **Late 20th Century**: As illegal immigration became a bigger issue, border security operations such as \"Operation Hold-the-Line\" (1993) in El Paso, Texas, and \"Operation Gatekeeper\" (1994) in California were initiated. These focused on deterrence by fortifying the most frequented crossing points.\n\nIn sum, while the U.S.-Mexico border has long been an area of interest, its significance and the nature of concerns have evolved over time. The modern concept of \"border security\" emphasizing illegal immigration, smuggling, and potential threats has its roots in the latter half of the 20th century but was built upon a foundation of earlier concerns related to sovereignty, economic interests, and regional stability.",

          "ParentCommentText": "The strategy of using population movements as a war tactic, often referred to as \"population transfer\" or \"settler colonialism,\" has been employed in various historical contexts. This strategy involves moving a portion of a country's or empire's population into a contested or conquered territory with the aim of establishing dominance, altering the demographic balance, or both. Here are a few notable examples:\r\n\r\nRoman Empire: The Romans used the settlement of their citizens in conquered territories as a means of securing control over these areas, integrating them into the empire, and Romanizing the local population. This was not only a tactic for solidification of their control but also served as a reward to Roman soldiers or citizens, granting them lands in the new territories.\r\n\r\nThe Settlement of Siberia: Russia expanded into Siberia from the 16th century onwards, using Cossacks and Russian settlers to colonize the vast territories. The settlers served as a means to claim land, extract resources, and integrate Siberia into the Russian state.\r\n\r\nBritish Colonization of North America and Australia: The British Empire settled its citizens in various parts of the world, including North America and Australia. These settlements often involved the displacement of indigenous populations and were used as a means to control and economically exploit these territories.\r\n\r\nZionist Movement and Israel: The Zionist movement, from the late 19th century and particularly after World War II, encouraged the immigration of Jews to Palestine, then under British control. The goal was to establish a Jewish homeland, which culminated in the founding of Israel in 1948. This has led to ongoing conflict with the Palestinian population over land and statehood.\r\n\r\nChinese Settlement in Tibet and Xinjiang: The People's Republic of China has been accused of using Han Chinese settlement in minority regions like Tibet and Xinjiang as a means to assert control, dilute the indigenous cultures, and integrate these regions more closely with the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nThese examples show that the strategy of using population movements as a war tactic or as a means of control can have long-lasting effects on the demographic, cultural, and political landscapes of the affected areas. The reasons for such strategies have varied, including economic exploitation, strategic control, cultural assimilation, and the establishment of new national identities.",

Someone very skilled has been breaking into Muslim households and murdering two to three men at a time. The young men think they're untouchable until this person shows up and kills them. This has been going on for a few months and UNCHECKED  immigration has let this serial killer right into the country to feed off the young men who have embarrassed themselves by bad behavior and now someone has come from no where killing them.  There is a reward to catch this killer and the reward now is $57,000  I think the murders will stop when the killer gets board or gets caught.  I agree and now people know that UNCHECKED immigration just isn't working. Hopefully no more serial killers come.",

I personally don't have a problem with Catholics but 30 years ago there was a group of muslims in California who were texting hate texts to eachother about catholic people.  One of the texts read ( bash a catholic to lift up) I find it disturbing and disgusting that anyone would promote that sort of behavior. The seven Muslim men involved in this hate game 🐂💩 were eventually arrested for a violent crime they took part in and they were deported.  I have also heard that they were killed some years ago when Syria had its civil war.  Maybe that happened for the best. Not all of us Muslims are good or kind. Many who come to America despise America but want to come to make everyone else uncomfortable.  Like burning flags and inciting violence.",

Many Liberals tend to hate \"nationalism\" but SOME degree of nationalism is needed, especially in a country of immigrants. \n\n Many think that if we stamp out all patriotism and nationalism, then we all become one human family. I'm Swedish and Sweden has gone VERY far in this mindset of basically  erasing or downplaying national identity. Paradoxically, instead of becoming one happy family, erasing patriotism makes people retreat entirely into SUB-national identities (race, religion, tribe, political identity etc). And such societies become ever more unstable, volatile and ungovernable. Good examples are Yugoslavia, Iraq, Lebanon.",

I would also say that it's moreso a problem of integration since we've seen sucess stories of immigration in other places such as the USA. There are no quick fixes to the spiraling crime, what needs to happen is that schools, social services and police are able to work together in taking precautionary meausures to make sure that our youth don't fall into a lifestyle of crime. In this an important part is to clearly signal to people struggling in school that there is an alternative to a life of crime, that there are plenty of good work oppurtunities and that a non-criminal alternative is possible.",

I would also say that it's moreso a problem of integration since we've seen sucess stories of immigration in other places such as the USA. There are no quick fixes to the spiraling crime, what needs to happen is that schools, social services and police are able to work together in taking precautionary meausures to make sure that our youth don't fall into a lifestyle of crime. In this an important part is to clearly signal to people struggling in school that there is an alternative to a life of crime, that there are plenty of good work oppurtunities and that a non-criminal alternative is possible.",

In the real world production of cars and car parts increased in average about 15% p.a. since Feb. 2021 and sales value increased about 10% p.a. in the same time. Germany is by now the 3rd biggest economy by GDP, although this is rather temporary and we certainly swap back places with Japan this or next year. Besides, cars aren't by far the only products of Germany. Also, apart from Tesla there aren't many American brands that are really competing because their cars wouldn't sell in Europe, something like their beloved huge trucks. Also American brand SUVs don't sell great in Europe. On the other hand a big amount of SUVs sold in Europe are US built, since most manufacturers like BMW have factories in the US for such cars because the biggest market is there.",

Could be your employer paid too little tax.. Off you go or your place of residency was faulty or say, your employer filled out your name incorrectly. It seems like every week there is another story. Even students that come here to study then decide to stay to work aren't safe either. Even Ukrainians that fled the war are being treated like absolute garbage here.",

Both countries are quite similar in their attitude towards foreign refugees, so I can imagine that very well.\nAnd yes, I have witnessed it.\n In 2015 we had a Kurdish guy, 21 years old, in a refugee Camp close to our neighbourhood: Cool guy, told us he fled from Aleppo. \nUsed to play football with us youngsters (was 15 myself back then) worked first in the supermarket, later in a turkish bakery/café in our town, he used to be a baker he said, and he could make great Baklava. He earned his own living, he learned german, in 2017 just had passend his B1 level.\nAnd then he got deported. After 3 fucking years of integration, learning the language, working his ass off, he got deported. I still don't know why. Simply because his asylum wasn't granted. \nAnd 2 years later, a migrant from Somalia, who had been granted temporary asylum, stabbed several persons in the street, in the bavarian city of \"Würzburg\".\n He was shot if I recall correctly, but that guy was known to be mentally ill, aggressive, came in trouble with the law several times before...why the heck was HE granted asylum, but a peaceful, skilled baker got deported?\nWhy was that murderer not deported, the first time he broke the law, even if it was a much smaller crime? But a hard-working, integrsted person was... \nAs you say, it is not very intelligent...",

I've noticed Swedes are open to accepting refugees and immigrants just as long as they don't move into their neighborhood. I am light skinned so I don't pass for Fijian and at a social gathering some of the things other party goers said about Afghans and Somali was shocking, I had someone complain to me about foreigners who then said \"but not you, you're one of the good ones\". Of course it's just my experience but from a non white immigrants perspective I felt Australia to be much more accepting of me than Sweden.",

The difference between Germany and Australia is that Germany has dealt with its historic past in a completely different way than Australia has done. But regardless, it's the present I'm talking about. English is not my first language and did not know that word in English, so that was what translat suggested. I do not know the word in English, but will try to explain it. That is when there is racism at the state level, and that there is racism built into regulatory legislation, in the labor market, the housing market, etc. It is not that you get racist swear words directed at you or that people are directly racist towards you.\r\nThere are a lot of studies on this showing a built-in such racism in Australia, many representatives of nationalist / racist parties in Europe have Australia as a model country for how they want Europe to change legislation etc.\r\nJust to mention one thing is that refugees are placed in what can be seen as a prison in Narue, that they do not get their asylum right tried.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpMA5jKwXn4&ab_channel=TRTWorldhtthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHSWMfpJtU4&ab_channel=DWDocumentary",

Yes the crime rate did increase but apart from this, Germany also received the workers they needed. Turks nowadays are living here since 3 generations. They integrated themselves better than most Syrians afghan or Iranian people, who are here since 8 years now and the stats are not lying. They found out that 2/3 of the immigrants  who came here in 2015 ( who are mostly Arabs) still are jobless, and that was the major problem. Immigrants from Ukraine did integrate themselves better and started to work although they are only here since 2 years , and most of them are woman and children. And we also have to mention that turkey in the 70s 80s was indeed a better developed country than today and better than the middle eastern countries. Look man they weren’t academics but I didn’t even say that. I say that they were educated which is whole different meaning ( basically I said that most of them went to a school) . For many people it just takes time to integrate but imagine you are a Syrian immigrant who is living here since 8 years. No job , you don’t know the language and obviously don’t want to learn it either, and you begin to commit crimes. That just simply a cultural and ethnicall problem. We need more worker here in Germany but definitely not of the Arabic countries since they are taking to long to integrate themselves",

You are delusional if you think they are here for anything less then American benefits and taxpayer money.  We owe them nothing and they should all be sent back and apply through legal channels. They are nothing but  criminals stealing our money. If you don't see that you are totally hopeless. What possible reason can you come up with that says we need to take these people in illegally? They need to go NOW. And as far as the US causing their problems that is just total unadulterated BS.",

Once the capital in the expertise have been given, they nationalized a.k.a. stole billions of dollars worth of resources.  You can't possibly imagine that we could just let that go. Do you honestly believe that there would be any ability to make an investment in a developing country if we simply sat back and said if you steal our stuff that's OK? Give me a break and then they started threatening the country. Why aren't you upset or suggesting that Russia destabilized that country because Russia was the one who kept looking for dictatorial, strong men in the area.",

This happens when common criminals hide among honest migrants, enter a European Country and begin to do crimes. Because of them, honest immigrants get hated by the local people who sometimes become racist as they erroneously associate ethnicity with behaviour, ignoring that lots of honest immigrants had their reputation damaged in the first place.",

Advanced Parole can run you an additional $575 if you file it separately from your I-485. We had a single RFE which was $2200 in legal fees to resolve. N-400 is $725. And we spent about $400 just on postage sending original documents back and forth as needed via fedex airmail.

Not to mention the monies to make the filings. But we did it ourselves, not using an attorney.

When my grandfather came, there were no interstate highways the loan and Internet. There wasn't a vast network of post office is or retail shops or machinery to do basic jobs. Heck, they first car wasn't even sold for another 15 years or so. When most of our ancestors came there were few basic services being provided and taxpayers certainly didn't provide them with free housing or delivered meals lat alone cash payments. They were kept at Ellis long enough to screen them and then they were shown the door either in to the country or out of it. Because the country was so raw there were plenty of jobs to be done so folks weren't a burden which is why sororities kind of issues. I would also remind you that yes there was still a backlash. The Italians weren't welcome to the \nIrish weren't welcomed etc. etc. because our forefathers created something special here and it's not unreasonable to not want others to come and f*ck it up",

You don't just get to INVADE another established nation and that nation then give you thousands of dollars and medical and education while IGNORING it's own citizens who are in trouble, poor, and homeless, and facing disasters of all kinds.\nThe United States is an established nation, and whether they built that nation by taking over land that others occupied HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO just DOES NOT MATTER TODAY.\nBecause EVERY established nation is a result of people FIGHTING OVER AND TAKING OVER LAND and then making a NATION out of it.\nINCLUDING all the African nations and Asian nations and European nations.\nDo you think YOUR ancestors never took land and had slaves? You would very likely be WRONG.\nDo you think YOUR ancestors never sinned against others, never murdered or stole, never raped and pillaged?\nYou would be WRONG.\nStop blaming people TODAY for the past that was hundreds of years ago. WE WERE ALL BORN CITIZENS HERE and WE ABIDE BY OUR LAWS.\nBut the illegals do NOT abide by our laws - they bring massive crime, disease, chaos, destabilization of our country, and this was all done ON PURPOSE in order to DESTROY AMERICA.\nYou have NO CLUE what's really going on, do you?? You have ZERO CLUE that you're about to LOSE the country you keep hating and blaming other people about and you'll be REPLACED by illegals who didn't PAY for this nation like WE did.\nWhen the ish hits the fan and this country finally goes down because of people that YOU voted for, who you gonna cry to THEN?? \nEver seen America in this HORRIBLE condition before?? Has it ever occurred to you that this is all being done ON PURPOSE to TAKE your country away from you and either kill or ENSLAVE you?\nWhat's our gonna take to WAKE YOU UP TO THE TRUTH??\nDo they have to starve you to death, or kill you with another💉, or make you homeless and drug addicted, or have illegals invade YOUR house and steal YOUR money before you get it??\nBecause they ARE invading your house and stealing your money!! They are being given EVERYTHING that American citizens are NOT being given. We have mass homeless, crime and murder, violence, inflation, invasion, disasters - BECAUSE OF PEOPLE YOU SUPPORT, and they're doing all this DELIBERATELY to kill our country.\nWhen it all goes down HARD, don't say you weren't warned.",

All of our immigration laws were for only white people, that's what our actual founding fathers had in mind, so how is being American not being of European descent. No we haven't always been intertwined, when we had leaders who cared about our people that kept nonwhites out. But America has been invaded/taken over by anti-white communists, so now invaders like you get to be here to rewrite our history with the lie that \"America is diverse\" and being an American means anything lol. I know you and other nonwhites want to pretend to be a part of something that you could never build or create on your own because you're ashamed of the quality of your own countries. You don't even want to live around your own people, what does that say lol",

But ukrainian labor(mostly men) existed before the war in large numbers.\nBtw i don't blame the ukrainians who don't fight. Why shoudl they die in a pointless war?\nI don't blame the Afghans either, who don't want to live under the Taliban.\nBasicly i understand the migration, but if you are migrant you should respect the rules and traditions of the host country",

Think on it what would happened if the russians threw away his goverment in 2022! Maybe less freedom, but better life for sure. I would like to draw your attention to all German, French and American, !!!ALL OF THEM!!! research after the annexation of Crimea.

Cuz they have better life now than before.\nBut i set it reverse for you: If the US invaded your country, would you not fight to defend your country? Cuz people who do so are brave heroes in Ukraine and mindless terrorists in the middle east. Didn't you see the fight of the iraqi people's resistance pointless? i'm sure you did.\nI know it is not plesent to hear that but you ukrainians are tools. And believe me every time when i'm in the cold comes to my mind the ukrainian childern in their home they have to suffer more longer in the cold, without electricity, sometimes water. Soldiers in the ditches both ukrainians and russians. Do not think they are more brainwashed than you. And it is not your and not their faults, but you leaders. And i know the war never changes, sooner or later but all battle becomes barbaric, clumsy hth combat in the mud, blood and shit. I know and feel better than the westboys in their comfortable life from their armchairs. This is why i say it is pointless and this is why they say:let's go fight! There is nothing noble and romantic in the war. And believe me, most of the russians feel the justice is in their side just as you do. It is a fckin shame but you won't achieve anything. Even if you would so , look around you and ask yourselves: Is it worth?  No country supports Ukraine with moral reasons(except few), but for self interest. Our world works like that, there is no justice here. I know it hurts you, but this is the truth. You cannot find good and bad in global politics, you can find those standards in your personal life only. \nBut i will answear your question. if Russia(it can be any other great power like USA, China etc) would attack my country and our goverment would be a good goverment, then  i would fight for my country and i would die for my country pointlessly. That would be my duty but that would be still pointless to wage war against great powers. So i would fight but i would have no doubt i will die in vain",

They are all corrupt, spineless creatures with no moral and Zelensky is one of the worst. You think he is before 24.02.2022 and before the massive western propaganda. Think on it what would happened if the russians threw away his goverment in 2022! Maybe less freedom, but better life for sure. I would like to draw your attention to all German, French and American, !!!ALL OF THEM!!! research after the annexation of Crimea. It came out everywhere that by 2019, even the majority of Crimean Tatars did not regret that. But in 2014, most of them did not want it. How could that be? Cuz they have better life now than before.\nBut i set it reverse for you: If the US invaded your country, would you not fight to defend your country? Cuz people who do so are brave heroes in Ukraine and mindless terrorists in the middle east. Didn't you see the fight of the iraqi people's resistance pointless? i'm sure you did.\nI know it is not plesent to hear that but you ukrainians are tools. And believe me every time when i'm in the cold comes to my mind the ukrainian childern in their home they have to suffer more longer in the cold, without electricity, sometimes water. Soldiers in the ditches both ukrainians and russians. Do not think they are more brainwashed than you. And it is not your and not their faults, but you leaders. And i know the war never changes, sooner or later but all battle becomes barbaric, clumsy hth combat in the mud, blood and shit. I know and feel better than the westboys in their comfortable life from their armchairs. This is why i say it is pointless and this is why they say:let's go fight! There is nothing noble and romantic in the war. And believe me, most of the russians feel the justice is in their side just as you do. It is a fckin shame but you won't achieve anything. Even if you would so , look around you and ask yourselves: Is it worth?  No country supports Ukraine with moral reasons(except few), but for self interest. Our world works like that, there is no justice here. I know it hurts you, but this is the truth. You cannot find good and bad in global politics, you can find those standards in your personal life only. \nBut i will answear your question. if Russia(it can be any other great power like USA, China etc) would attack my country and our goverment would be a good goverment, then  i would fight for my country and i would die for my country pointlessly. That would be my duty but that would be still pointless to wage war against great powers. So i would fight but i would have no doubt i will die in vain",

They dont have the same views,values as fellow European countries do, middle east doesnt believe in human rights, its religion before all else, Sweden are almost religion free and We value human rights here so it doesnt add up at all!\n\nRefugees from Ukraine are fellow europeans with the same values as swedes do so its not a problem, you dont wanna build mosques here and try to put islam in the Swedish system or anything of cource you are more welcomed here",

          "ParentCommentText": "@User_611 The USA is all immigrants. I’m 2 nd generation American, my husband is from Turkey. We have always been stronger through our multi-cultural  melting pot. My Irish gg grandfather was hard working and got help from theCatholic church charity. The Christian support was the strength of America. Until we decided we don’t need God or values that we all know keep a culture working. So it’s happening everywhere, the world now understands the difference in The Eastern Muslim philosophy and the Western Christian values. Yeshua ( Jesus) \nsaid love God, your neighbor and especially your enemy. Muhammad said the exact opposite. Who would you want as your neighbor?",

But unlike the left, the racists in the right tend to be much more quiet and hidden, while the left open and brazingly advocate for segregation and special priviledges. They are the ones pushing us back to the early 1900s.\nHowever, I think there may be a difference in the right and left that you and I talk about...those two sides are completely different between the USA/Europe and the arabic world. Im talking about the right and left of the western world, as this video is about Sweden which is my own home land, and I do not claim to know anything about the middle eastern politics. I know more about japanese and chinese politics than middle eastern, and thats not by a lot. But what I do know is that India and the middle east are sort of like oil and water, that India has fought a lot to stop middle eastern invasions, so I can see a lot of animousity there on both sides. But do not equate us with them.",

Ill try to explain the situation in sweden right now and what is going on. Sweden is not trying to push out indians or brown people.specially law abiding ones. What is going on is that we have a rise in crime, from both 2nd and 3rd gen immigrants as well as immigrants from the huge migrant wave about 6-7 years ago.These people were not indians. They were from Syria, Somalia and the middle east. They dont want to conform to swedens culture and prefer becoming criminals. Its the criminals we want to get rid of, not some vague brown people. And I can attest that its true that crime has risen. In the past we never had shootings or bombings and it was front page news...now even I have been in close proximity to one of the bombings. Thankfully it was on a car parking lot and not near my home.",

          "ParentCommentText": "User_634  dude, the normal right isnt racist. But I do know there is racist on the right too, they can be in any group. But unlike the left, the racists in the right tend to be much more quiet and hidden, while the left open and brazingly advocate for segregation and special priviledges. They are the ones pushing us back to the early 1900s.\nHowever, I think there may be a difference in the right and left that you and I talk about...those two sides are completely different between the USA/Europe and the arabic world. Im talking about the right and left of the western world, as this video is about Sweden which is my own home land, and I do not claim to know anything about the middle eastern politics. I know more about japanese and chinese politics than middle eastern, and thats not by a lot. But what I do know is that India and the middle east are sort of like oil and water, that India has fought a lot to stop middle eastern invasions, so I can see a lot of animousity there on both sides. But do not equate us with them.",

No noone has implemented arabic laws here yet, thankfully! The right didnt become more fervent from Trump, the left did! They kept crying about Trump even after he stoped being president. They tried to jail him even though they were lying and he was innocent. And abolutely not, I do not think about Turkey even being brown! I dont even blame Turkey, I blame Erdogan for being an arse but again nothing to do with his skin. I dont really even care if Sweden end up on nato, i dunno if thats right or not. All you know is a lie! Step out of your bubble and go listen to people on the right! They are really nice! Gothix and Thomas Sowell are great people to start with.",

If they litter, they are severely punished. \nIf you are worried that indians are dirty, you should worry about the africans.

I'm not here to argue the politics themselves since doing that in the youtube comments has absolutely no affect on the world nor would it change anybody's opinions as politics is nothing more than a team game or tribalism on the internet. But if you truly have something important to say go be a politician and be the change you want to see.. also I'm English buddy so no I haven't bothered looking up the constitution, but again not about politics.

It's very difficult to ignore all of that lol.\n\nAnd you mentioned TV which generally features channels that are not from the home country of your parents (unless you pay for a separate subscription). \n\nMy parents also used to work a lot before the pandemic, my dad works from home and my mom occasionally goes on long hours because she's a doctor. But even then, I am as Americanized as it gets tbh while retaining some parts of the culture of my parents.",

          "CommentText": "User_663  wrote, _\"nobody under 90 years old would put what they are replying to I quotations like that\"_\n\nIt's a consideration born out of necessity. Once a thread grows beyond 40 or 50 replies, very few people will go back through it to see what someone else is making a vague reference to. By quoting people, nobody has to go searching for 'what they heck is he talking about?'\n\ntony: _\"They felt I had loads of intelligent things to say.\"_\n\nThat's probably because during the interview you didn't say anything that resembles, _\"like your daddy Mr trump\"_\n\nYou see, Tony, you're the one who set the tone. Which is important to keep in mind, especially since you wrote:\n\n_\"you miserably resort to calling people unintelligent and kids\"_\n\nWhat I did is mirror your tone. The fact that you recognized it in my reply to you, but not in your reply to me, suggests either that you're a hypocrite, or as I wrote previously, just not all that smart.\n\nIf you had a job interview and they thought you were smart, but you write here in ways that give the appearance that  you are NOT smart... do you think the problem is me mirroring you? Or, is it more likely that you cared about presenting your best self during the interview while here, in contrast, you don't really care whether you look stupid?\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts about all this.\n\ntony: _\"on YouTube for your entetainment....\"_\n\nNow that's ironic. Do you know what 'psychological projection' is, Tony? No, apparently you don't. Well, you just did that: you accused me of talking down to people for my entertainment even though your first comment to me was _\"like your daddy Mr trump\"_\n\nDefinitely ironic.\n\nBy the way, I notice that you ignored the facts about you assuming things about me. Is that how you resolve that cognitive dissonance, Tony? You just ignore the facts that reflect poorly on you, and then recriminate to shift attention away from you to the person you're talking down to... insulting... etc.?\n\nAs you can see, such 'tactics' don't work on people who care about the truth of the topic being discussed.",

You know what they say: If nothing is for sale, you're the product. That saying is not the case here, but by the same vein, why is this non-reporter business man taking the time to set up a meeting with cameras to briefly discuss the border with Financial Times for 7 minutes, basically repeating the same information 3x over? It's so heavy-handed. Questioning sources and affluent people with power is always necessary, lest they be strangely worshipped and, dare I say it, fully trusted. The story is so old and the signs are all there.    User_062 \n\nEdit: Ok, it is a form of bias just by definition.

This administration should be held accountable for the deaths of any who try to cross because they opened the boarder and did not follow the law. You will not make us fill guilty for them dying in a river this administration gave permission for them to cross. And those that can't see this is a problem have some form of mental brain issues going on. They should not be allowed to make decisions for the sane.This is not a racist thing.

          "ParentCommentText": "User_056  illegals are treated the same way as a legal person  would in the state I'm in , TX. As a matter of fact a person's immigration status is completely inadmissible and holds no bearing on the outcome result of the accident. The same thing happens to legal citizens or legal immigrants w a work pass. Citizenship is not allowed to be requested in accident cases in TX. So basically it sux either way, if you're hit by ANYONE without insurance. Legal or not.\nSo in the state of TX...you're screwed. It's happened to me b4 and I had a helluva time trying to get my insurance company to pay me for my car being totalled. I had full coverage so that included uninsured motorists of course. We can't expect to hold someone more responsible for something they do wrong just because of thier immigration status. The big problem is the insurance companies trying to screw everyone over. They are total for profit companies and will try to prove that if you had even a percentage of fault in the accident, they should not be at all responsible. That's what happened to me, only he was a legal citizen. . If ppl are allowed to purchase insurance and get licenses then all the unpaid cases would not be so. But you're still gonna have those ppl who think they don't need to pay  for insurance, regardless of their immigration status.",

As a matter of fact a person's immigration status is completely inadmissible and holds no bearing on the outcome result of the accident. The same thing happens to legal citizens or legal immigrants w a work pass. Citizenship is not allowed to be requested in accident cases in TX. So basically it sux either way, if you're hit by ANYONE without insurance. Legal or not.\nSo in the state of TX...you're screwed. It's happened to me b4 and I had a helluva time trying to get my insurance company to pay me for my car being totalled. I had full coverage so that included uninsured motorists of course.

The government has known undocumented people live here and they know they support the economy in a huge way that would devastate us if they left. Tell me why the gov will give them their own version of an SS# but not a drivers license or insurance? Your argument was insurance premiums. Think it could be that this exact argument benefits neither the undocumented nor us citizen? But it DOES benefit the insurance companies. Undocumented people are TERRIFIED of police. The second they hit your car, of course many are going to run. The difference in a small accident like that is their entire life ripped away. It's the same reason the MAJORITY of undocumented people don't drive. Understand that if they could they would because it would protect them even more than it would protect you. Above this, the fact is you know, I know, and the government knows where our food comes from and we allllll know your white ass isn't gonna be out there in the 100+ degree fields picking shit. It's called exploitation and it fuels capitalism and it fuels hate, greed, and fear...all of which fuels the GOP and keeps you spinning your hamster wheel where they want you. If you'd only open your eyes around you and LISTEN to any of \"these people\"...meet them and learn from them. We all agree borders shouldn't be wide open (and they aren't),  but the difference is your proposed solutions are rooted in hate and misinformation rather than logic and compassion. If more people sat and listened I think we could get there and actually work TOGETHER on bipartisan immigration reform.",

Again using misinformation to justify the the invasion and occupation of lands that don’t belong to you \nis exhibit B regarding the incompetence used to justify colonial criminality. First, in 1947 the UN back by the US and UK were responsible for selecting Palestine as the homeland for European Jews that served the holocaust using both Hebrew and Christian scriptures to justify the theft of somebody else’s land. Imma need for you to be think, if possible, about how implausible a country only 20 years in the game could defeat all the Arab countries? Which ones and with whose help additionally, there has been an ongoing conflict since long before’67.  The Israeli Palestinian conflict mirrors would occurred in the Americas. Take your land and cultural identity, a piece at a time until eventually it’s all stolen. Period, but when you call it out we’re the crybabies with a victim mentality while making yourself the victims. It’s clear who’s engaged in the crybaby antics. No matter how you slice it to take away word for today is criminal, illegal behavior, who really needs to grow up? Mentally and spiritually cause you still in toddler phase",

Half of those days are worth 80% of a maximum salary of about 40,000 SEK/month. The rest of the days are worth half that. Calculated over the entire year you get about 60% of your salary unless you earn more than 40,000 SEK/month. \n\n2. The income tax is not 52%. It's the second tax bracket after 52000 SEK/month. Everything above 52000 is taxed 52%. 80% of the population earn less than 52000 and taxes around 28-32%, depending on your city. \n\n3.

          "CommentText": "A few errors in the video. \n\n1. Parents get 240 days each but those are not fully paid. Half of those days are worth 80% of a maximum salary of about 40,000 SEK/month. The rest of the days are worth half that. Calculated over the entire year you get about 60% of your salary unless you earn more than 40,000 SEK/month. \n\n2. The income tax is not 52%. It's the second tax bracket after 52000 SEK/month. Everything above 52000 is taxed 52%. 80% of the population earn less than 52000 and taxes around 28-32%, depending on your city. \n\n3. Pensioners don't get as much as they did when they were in the workforce. They get roughly half. This is why it is important to have a private saving for your retirement.",

Sure not all but most most most of them just wanna get free stuff and also do crimes.  There are dozens and dozens of reports of this scum committing crimes in all countrys they enter on this planet. Look at ireland it was i guess there its already escalating look at france.  There were some individuals i guess it were about 20 who decided to kill white ppl and so they raided an event from a small town and they drove quiet some kilometers for this. They ended up killing some and some got hurt.  They deserve to be sent back on the boat they came with but without helpers that bring them over this time. Say goodby to the human garbage with no civilised behavior.",

They ask for asylum: by federal law that is legal! You might not like the law, but doesn't mean they broke it! Lets change the immigration system back to normal... because is broken! yes! Felons are the ones that cross the border hiding by the authorities...! We can talk about no wanting more ppl here, I am open the debate yes! But again: you are confusing asylum seekers with ppl crossing with \"coyotes\" 2 different things. By the way: 65 to 75% of asylum seekers will be denied! The new policy require 3 points they have to be able to pass to be accepted: most ppl will not pass them!",

Half of those days are worth 80% of a maximum salary of about 40,000 SEK/month. The rest of the days are worth half that. Calculated over the entire year you get about 60% of your salary unless you earn more than 40,000 SEK/month. \n\n2. The income tax is not 52%. It's the second tax bracket after 52000 SEK/month. Everything above 52000 is taxed 52%. 80% of the population earn less than 52000 and taxes around 28-32%, depending on your city. \n\n3. Pensioners don't get as much as they did when they were in the workforce. They get roughly half. This is why it is important to have a private saving for your retirement.",

The rest of the days are worth half that. Calculated over the entire year you get about 60% of your salary unless you earn more than 40,000 SEK/month. \n\n2. The income tax is not 52%. It's the second tax bracket after 52000 SEK/month. Everything above 52000 is taxed 52%. 80% of the population earn less than 52000 and taxes around 28-32%, depending on your city. \n\n3. Pensioners don't get as much as they did when they were in the workforce. They get roughly half. This is why it is important to have a private saving for your retirement.",

          "CommentText": "​User_849  Are you the typical leftist victim-mentality brown/black person who now wants to label this as \"racism\", because you don't understand one thing about what this man is talking about, what they are doing to us Europeans? Or do you simply not care because the only thing you see is \"black/brown people are the victim always, never the perpetrator or aggressor\"? \nTrust me, most Europeans understand exactly what he's talking about, except those who are too far gone into the leftist agenda. \n\n\nThis whole thing isn't even about race or skin color or whatever in the first place. At least from our pov. It's about attitude, lack of respect for our culture, for us Europeans. I mean, look at the internet nowadays. Wherever you look, people think it's okay to talk shit about us, are racist towards us Europeans, the US or Caucasians in general. \nAlso, they are trying to spread the idea that we aren't even a race. That we don't belong to a race, I mean do you think that is okay? \nThat is \"Volksverhetzung\", sorry don't know the English word because I'm a racist Nazi German woman who doens't have English as their first language.\nIt's an attempt to dehumanize us, to make us into something not human. Dunno, may be some coping mechanism so they don't have to feel bad about what their countries are doing to us (Africa and muslim world flooding us with their losers and criminals, Asian countries infiltrating us with cheap work forces who often steal technology or spy, flooding our markets with cheap or even fake products, cyber attacks to destroy our economy and lastly Russia who's openly engaging in a genocide) or maybe it's simple and pure racism, who knows. But then, it can't be racism, because you can't be racist towards white people right? Because we don't even belong to a race. 😂\n\nWhen some young African or Asian woman or dude makes a video about comparing their culture to an European or generally western one, they most often will use that chance to talk trash about us, insulting our culture as being \"savage\" compared to theirs or pick any other result (um, well we don't skin and eat animals alive, actively claiming the meat tastes better when the animal suffered before, but okay). You could make a neutral video, testing both sides and then saying you prefer your own culture in that aspect. But no. \n\nWith all the hate, racism, infiltration, invasion, open and hidden attacks we face, it's no wonder our hospitality and tolerance will diminish over time. \nWe are tired of all the anti-white propaganda all around the world, even our own governments telling us everythign is okay when our women and children are getting r*ped left and right? Our men getting robbed or killed left and right? Because the perpetrators are not from here, we have to turn a blind eye? That's disgusting. Mabye I should go to Africa and start killing off people, but oh no, then I'd be a racist. Hmm weird but when Africans and Arabs do this here in Europe, they are NOT racist? Very weird. Bad propaganda. 😂",

I have worked also in England in areas where there were lots of Arabs, never had a problem there only nice interactions. I don't know why in Sweden they were acting like that but they were.  I'm  Caucasian  and if people like me go to other countries and act up when people describe who did it it would be unfair to throw up the racism card so why the double standard.",

Another thing, no real muslim would be 'looking for trouble'. You clearly think any brown guy you run into that causes you a hassle is suddenly 'muslim'. I suggest you take time to actually study the religion and its teachings so you can have a factual view instead of basing it on stereotypes that are absurdUser_850 ",

All you do to argue with people who have problems with immigrants is call them '-ists' and '-isms' and use buzzwords to describe their apparent ignorance like 'prejudice', 'phobic'.  EVERYONE can see its a serious problem even in the statistics; 900% increase in rapes and stabbings in sweden since the refugees came in.  Huge crime increases caused specifically by the immigrant population.  That is NOT prejudice, thats judgement based on facts.  Prejudice is judging a group or person before getting to know them or granting them a chance.  Use some common sense, there IS a serious problem with muslim immigrants (and other cultures) to western countries.  To seriously discuss what solutions there can be to it it is totally useless to come into the conversation and just call anyone who has a concern about their society as being racist or ignorant.",

They also don't believe that there are countries in Europe where this is not happening because all they know and want to know is their arrogant and insular \"west-is-the-best\" attitude. And from my perspective, the west is not what it used to be some 15 years ago and every year it's getting worse.

Europeans went around the globe exploring other people for their land, labor, and resources, and in the process disrupted those nations because broken nations allow for the cheap extraction of resources. \n\nCombine this with the desired cheap labor the white oligarchy desires and you have everything Europeans complain about now. \n\nYou can’t go around the world destabilizing things and then be surprised at the outcome. \n\nPredatory capitalism is at the root of these problems but most white people fail to see it. \n\nTheir logic revolves around white exceptionalism where they think other people are the way they are with zero consideration at European Geo politics. Most white folks don’t pay attention. They just think immigrants just showed up because they recognize white as awesome. No - they recognize that white people have vacuumed up most of the planets resources.",

          "ParentCommentText": "User_885  The Canonized Bible was created around 367 AD in the ancient eastern city of Constantinople in a part of the world we now call Turky.  Almost all of the great theological decisions regarding the bible came from Constantinople and not from Rome.  Christianity flourished in the Eastern part of the word until the Muslims conquered Constantinople in 1453 AD and eliminated Christianity from the region. John had warned the seven churches of Asia Minor in the \"Book of Revelations\" that their faith was in danger of being eliminated in the region (Turkey and the Middle East) back in 94 AD.  Unfortunately, his prophecy came true even if it took over 1,000 years to happen.  You are overlooking the entire history of the Easter Christian Empire...The Byzantine Empire was at one time the dominant Christian empire on Earth.  All proof of Christ's existence was destroyed when the Muslims conquered Constantinople.  All evidence, and relics of Jesus, Mary, and the apostles were ordered to be destroyed by Sultan Mehmed II.  A list of what was destroyed was written and kept by Mehmed II, however legend has it that the many of the sacred artifacts were saved & that the Muslim world still has many artifacts of Jesus and Mary hidden.",

          "CommentText": "User_885  The Canonized Bible was created around 367 AD in the ancient eastern city of Constantinople in a part of the world we now call Turky.  Almost all of the great theological decisions regarding the bible came from Constantinople and not from Rome.  Christianity flourished in the Eastern part of the word until the Muslims conquered Constantinople in 1453 AD and eliminated Christianity from the region. John had warned the seven churches of Asia Minor in the \"Book of Revelations\" that their faith was in danger of being eliminated in the region (Turkey and the Middle East) back in 94 AD.  Unfortunately, his prophecy came true even if it took over 1,000 years to happen.  You are overlooking the entire history of the Easter Christian Empire...The Byzantine Empire was at one time the dominant Christian empire on Earth.  All proof of Christ's existence was destroyed when the Muslims conquered Constantinople.  All evidence, and relics of Jesus, Mary, and the apostles were ordered to be destroyed by Sultan Mehmed II.  A list of what was destroyed was written and kept by Mehmed II, however legend has it that the many of the sacred artifacts were saved & that the Muslim world still has many artifacts of Jesus and Mary hidden.",

          "CommentText": "My grandparents immigrated from Poland, Post-War to the United States of America. My grandfather took work as a painter and my grandmother became fluent in English and took up work with a major media outlet. \nbetween that, and my grandfather's army pension, they built for themselves and their family a comfortable life, that was similar to that of others in this Great Nation whose families had left Europa decades before, for our shores. Two of their children grew up and served our nation as soldiers. \n\nFrankly, the way many of those non-European immigrants behave would make it easy for me to be ok with certain general statements if it were not (and mainly so) for my own rent family history. And what really gets me, is Europeans and non-Europeans of European origin, who despite being aware of the problems those folks by and large cause, continue to be proponents of non-European immigration to European Nations. I am not saying that Europeans are above being absolute criminals (need we talk about what back-to-back Social occupation of Europa brought?) however, they tend to be more civilized and adapt better to whatever Nation they migrate to and they tend to do it legally. Up until recently Europeans (not the \"new European\" that publications like NatGeo and others like to flaunt)  being here illegally was so rare, that when a Polish doctor and an Irishman were deported, it made national news! \n\nOn a lighter note: despite myself and some of the other grandchildren not being Catholic, our grandparents still loved us!

When someone from Southern America emigrates to Europe, especially Mediterranean part, the integration is million times easier than if someone comes from subsaharan Africa or Arab countries, that's different civilization a big.

          "CommentText": "User_912  It would be a perfect world if everybody had the same attitude and feel gratitude towards the land that gave the person second chance for better life. The problem here are the muslims. Its in their nature not to feel any gratitude and not to respect our traditions, laws, rules. They come to Europe and they have demands, we have to start renaming our Xmas markets to Winter market just because of them and it is completely unacceptable. :( It is very sad how Europe is letting this to happen. My culture from where I come from is not such a big difference from the Belgian culture but still there are differences which I have adopted and I respect. Belgium is now my home and I contribute to the economy here meanwhile muslims they come and they dont want to work and they never contributed to anything here and they make our \"wallet\" empty because we have to keep on paying more and more taxes to be able to \"feed\" these people. They only bring misery, fear, criminality. Shame that this had to happen to our old continent. You are lucky to be in NZ. I am sure it must be an amazing country. We have got many filipinos here too but they are very peaceful and respectful people. Have a fantastic day 😊",

Sure the job was a big step back and I need to learn the language, but I work. Here I met second generation of immigrants who grow up here yet still don’t work. They don’t understand that social support doesn’t just fall from the sky, someone is working for you. Someone can’t afford to have their own child or home, so you could sit at home that was given to you and have your babies local population is paying for. I am sorry but if you’re of working age and healthy go to work and pay your own bills. I don’t care what’s your culture, gender or religion, if you don’t work you are not just useless to society, you are a burden that is raising other future burdens.",

I'm an ex-muslim, and before that I was still secular and pro-free speech. Exposure to ideas was all it took.\n\nCatholicism had it's dark period of theocracy, it was only through resistance and secular philosophers that pushed the Catholic church into political exile most countries. If catholicism as a 'culture' returned, it would be as regressive as the Islamic sub-cultures we are opposing. Already in America, the right wing is becoming increasingly theocratic, some pastors are actively calling for the execution of gay people. In florida teachers and students can't use the word 'gay'  because it's 'brainwashing'so students have to use code words and metaphors\n\nIn the end, a country must be united against totalitarianism, in all forms: Communism, Nazism, Christian theocracy, Islamic theocracy, pathological capitalism.",

Also interestingly enough even countries with the same religion of potential migrants do not want them . The Middle East countries are a good example , they do not want any muslims coming and settling in their countries , they want them coming to work and leaving and if for the same job there is a Muslim and a non Muslim they will choose the non Muslim as they know he will not create problems or consider there is something he is entitled to .",

When someone from Southern America emigrates to Europe, especially Mediterranean part, the integration is million times easier than if someone comes from subsaharan Africa or Arab countries, that's different civilization a big. I believe Christianity always had some value conflict with Islam, its two highly dynamic religions. Christianity became much more liberal, reformed and less aggressive, but Islam still remains mostly unreformed and very very strict.",

A poor carpenter, leading a group of uneducated misfits in what evidentially became an upstart religion.  A would-be Messiah named Jesus who was executed in Judea would be of no historical significance to any Greek or Roman historian.  Why would they write about that???  Executed Prophets were a dime a dozen.  The Jewish authorities sure as hell wouldn't write about him.  It was only about a hundred years later that the historians had some catching up to do. By the time any Greek or Roman historian would notice the rise of Christianity as a religion, and the importance of Jesus as a figure, Jesus was long gone.  Yes, Christianity is more liberal than the precursor Judaism and far more liberal than Islam which followed, but it is also far more conservative than the original Pegan religions of Western & Eastern Europe.",

          "CommentText": "User_885  What type of firsthand written evidence could possibly exist during the life of Jesus?  A poor carpenter, leading a group of uneducated misfits in what evidentially became an upstart religion.  A would-be Messiah named Jesus who was executed in Judea would be of no historical significance to any Greek or Roman historian.  Why would they write about that???  Executed Prophets were a dime a dozen.  The Jewish authorities sure as hell wouldn't write about him.  It was only about a hundred years later that the historians had some catching up to do. By the time any Greek or Roman historian would notice the rise of Christianity as a religion, and the importance of Jesus as a figure, Jesus was long gone.  Yes, Christianity is more liberal than the precursor Judaism and far more liberal than Islam which followed, but it is also far more conservative than the original Pegan religions of Western & Eastern Europe.",

Muslims will never blend in, they will never try to respect our culture and they will forse everyone else to adapt to their way of living. They dont even try (maybe like 5% of them) to blend in and integrate. They dont care and they bring their own misery and problems from what they were running away.

I do not fault the governments who open their doors for people in need of a safe home, I blame those immigrants who move to other countries to be a burden and to cause trouble for everyone, with their behaviour. If the solution is to close the door, I’m supportive of that. Even here, gangs, drugs and the disrespect for one another is getting worse because some people do not want to be Canadians in their hearts, they want to just enjoy the system benefits and be a burden on tax payers!!!    Some never even learn English or French and they stay here their entire life, have a lot of children who grow up and do nothing with their lives and burden the system even more 😢😢.",

All those countries you named are secular countries where there is no state religion and for example in Bosnia or Albania Muslims make around 50% of the population, so its not even majority religion. I should add that the form of islam there is very very liberal as i have visited Albania and Bosnia. You rly wanna start a debate with history graduate lol claiming something that christianity is from middle east and there are muslim minority countries in the Europe. Also its Europe not Eu if you even know the difference 🤡🤡 whats even the purpose of your arguments, i see zero value in them.",

They ARE NOT criminals, just desperate people looking for a better life. Why don't you follow your husband and move to Brazil? Wouldn't that be easier and cheaper?",

I am trying to relearn Français again as I've forgotten most of it. But yes many canadians are bilingual. I'd say there are more French Canadiens who can speak English than there are English canadians who can also speak french. But theres still many who speak both languages and both languages are taught in schools every across Canada. French is one of my favourite languages so I really want to master it someday soon!",

So now people shouldn't complain about the consequences of evil and stupid politics and blame it all on refugees who the politicians helped to create in the first place.",

Its much more complicated than the US being the only aggressive. The middle east was occupied by turkey (Ottoman), then by Britain, then divided up into new countries and Israel given to Jews. All of North Africa was occupied by arabs and made muslim. This was going on all over the world by most countries, However the west was the most successful in colonizing and its the most recent. The west has been the super power. We had other super powers before when the west was nothing. Now there is a big chance that Russia and China will grow much larger. Im not sure what you mean that Sweden should admit to and make up for? And is it only Sweden you think should do this? Or is it all countries whose former governments did wrong? Because then we will have exactly all countries on earth being aggressor and victim at some point in time. How do u make that right?",

          "ParentCommentText": "User_055  why would the child pay more taxes and have a harder life? Immigration is a positive for the economy. Especially when we're in a labor shortage. Remember it's conservatives who say economic growth benefits everyone. Well the economy just grew 4.9%. We need workers. Workers pay taxes. They buy or rent which means property taxes get paid and schools get funded. You cannot have economic growth without more people long term. Period.\n\nThe problem is that we working class don't get to share in the profit. Things just get more expensive. Why? Because rich people need more money. If you're paying more in taxes or groceries, it's rich people not immigrants. We pay more so an executive can buy a Mercedes or a third house. Not because a family in Honduras got a landscaping and cleaning job in America and rented an apartment.",

          "CommentText": "I'm going to give my perspective as an immigrant, I'm Chilean and I live in Brazil, I came here as a child for the first time in 1970. I'm also going to give my impression of what's happening in Chile right now. There are bad and good people in every group, and this is a truth that must always be considered! Immigrants have a tendency to seek out and have contact with others of the same nationality, maintaining a cultural bond, but... the immigrant must incorporate himself into the country that welcomed him, understand and accept the local culture, and not want to impose his or her culture (otherwise it is better to return to your country or look for a country with a similar culture). Immigrants should not have the right to vote or be political candidates... I don't consider it right, as there is no guarantee that an immigrant will not try to apply laws that favor their beliefs or their country of origin. Immigrants who do not respect local laws must be deported...! Why do I say all this? Precisely because there are good immigrants who want to work, to be useful to the country that welcomes them, and there are bad immigrants who are criminals or just going to enjoy the advantages that the country offers. I'm not saying that you can't help people, including immigrants, but you have to analyze whether you're really an honest person going through a bad time, or whether you're just someone who tries to take advantage of good citizens. Chile is currently going through a similar situation, with a large population of immigrants (many irregular) who consume State resources and do not contribute to anything... In the north of Chile, prisons contain more than 50% of immigrants, and in Chile, prisoners are not forced to work... The vast majority of land invaders, who demand their own homes, are immigrants... The Chilean State offers everything, but many immigrants believe it is their right to demand and gain all possible benefits, including houses. The big problem is that a society needs people who contribute, and who add behaviors and resources for the well-being of everyone. If a group just gains without giving anything (or very little), the weight falls on those who make an effort. Another point that has not been discussed is ideological, there is migration of people who want to destroy economic systems, cultures, and nations! There is a video of Venezuelan immigrants who call themselves \"destroyers of democracies\". It's not about being \"annoyed\", it's about protecting your culture and society...",
