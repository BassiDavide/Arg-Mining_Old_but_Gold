If you earn two times the average, it's 35%. So it's progressive and not the same for everyone. And even with the latter number and taken the 25% salestax, we're landing at 52%. And salestax isn't 25% for everything, other taxces are lower, too.\n\nMost of the guys who are aiming for the highest tax rate aren't even able to use basic arithmetic..you mustn't add taxe rates. And you will not reach 60% for average income at all..",

          "CommentText": "@User_044  nationalism often discriminates people from other nations. This on itself is radical in modern world that is multicultural. This discrimination often progress towards more brutal and physical actions. \n\nRest is dependent on the country. Chinese nationalism is different from Swedish because Sweden as a country generally contains less ethnicities on top of nations. So for example nationalism in Sweden won't be as dangerous as let's say in Germany because Sweden is not military superpower nor does it have huge population. Nevertheles nationalism often gives birth to groups that hate anyone that is not from their own nation. So for example it is 1 things to oppose immigration and oppose lack of assimiliation from let's say Middle East. But it is different to hate some 3rd generation immigrant, who spend whole life in Sweden, considers himself or herself as a Swede and apart from ethnicity have nothing to do with immigration. Yet to nationalist, these 2 people will be treated equally and by that I mean equally bad. \n\nNationalism was needed in XIX - early XX century to build a nation states, as it was also part of democratic movments (not always tho), but today everyone is nationalist by XIX standard so modern nationalism is far more descriminatory and so radical. I hope this helps.",

It holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-determination), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity,[5] and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power.[4][6] It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on a combination of shared social characteristics such as culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics (or the government), religion, traditions and belief in a shared singular history,[7][8] and to promote national unity or solidarity.[4] Nationalism, therefore, seeks to preserve and foster a nation's traditional culture.[9] There are various definitions of a \"nation\", which leads to different types of nationalism.[10] The two main divergent forms identified by scholars are ethnic nationalism and civic nationalism.",

We are meant to add something from our own homeland and embrace the new collective culture. Being america is part European part African part indigenous part Asian and yes part Latin American. You aren't meant to abandon the best parts of your own culture but you are meant to share them and then assimilate to that multicultural newly changed identity. That's why my favorite foods are Mexican and Italian, even though I'm nicer because Mexican food and Italian food is American food. It's sad that so many of us seem to have forgotten what makes us so awesome",

          "CommentText": "User_142  I can recall my own experiences where I offered what appeared to be a homeless man begging some food and he said to me that all he wanted was money. I knew what that meant and told him I can't do that.... But in anther situation, a young man approached me at a Shell gas station and asked for money to buy some food. I asked him to accompany to the restaurant in the gas station and bought him a bucket of chicken. He was appreciative. I guess it depends on the person and the demons their fighting.\n\nLately in my community this new drug \"flaka\" I believe it's called has made it's way and is causing some real damage. I've since become a bit more skeptical and selective",

In islam (that everyone here is seems mad at it) speaks of this clearly and call its a crime that will be questioned on the last day. \"And for what crime did they kill her\" speaking about the innocent female getting killed.\n its a human duty to protect the women from getting murderd based on their gender.\nDont try to blame this on one group when all of us know this is much older than any religion or culture.",

Her family also supports all the murdering of previous girls who were killed by their family for the same reasons.\n\nObviously not every middle easten family is like this, but there are still many that are. Having two extremely different cultures living togheter makes no sense, and I believe that teaching immigrants Swedish values/cultures is extremely important. Now all we have is a very divided community within Sweden.\n\nI'm not saying this because I hate immigrants. I'm myself an immigrant, and all my freinds are immigrants aswell lol",

Men killing women is the problem all over the world.\n\nNot killing women isnt a western concept, everwhere we have people out there putting effort. In islam (that everyone here is seems mad at it) speaks of this clearly and call its a crime that will be questioned on the last day. \"And for what crime did they kill her\" speaking about the innocent female getting killed.\n its a human duty to protect the women from getting murderd based on their gender.\nDont try to blame this on one group when all of us know this is much older than any religion or culture.",

Interesting enough, I found out that Turkey has many many more immigrants from Syria than most other countries, yet the crime rate in Turkish in e.g. Ankara is better than that of Stockholm. There is no way of escaping the unfortunate truth that is was the completely ignorant Swedish immigration policies that ruined the countries, _not_ the immigrants, because high rates of immigrants and even, as it seems, a lot of Syrian immigrants do not have similar consequences in other countries.",

They just don't follow the ideology you'd want them to. \"They like Putin\" is a long way from \"they don't alling with the EU and USA\".\n\nAlso, don't expect the same people who caused this issue to solve this problem as you are saying.\n\nAnd immigration is a big problem when you welcome people with a different cultural background than the ones already existing peacefully in your country. You had Christians and atheists. You welcomed muslims who want to bring Sharia law with them. They also make many children and ensure they also become muslims. So far, the previous government not only made the crime rate kncrease but also endangered the future of Sweeden because the muslims who want Sharia law for everyone will eventually become the majority. At that point Sweeden will become like the nations these people fled from in the first place.\n\nAnd Milei is not facing the same isues as Sweeden. Argentina is economically endangered, not culturally threatened by a horde of muslim immigrants. You are literally comparing apples to tomatoes.\n\nThough, I agree Javier Milei may, in fact, be the best leader in the world at this point. Maybe Trump will surpass him in 2024 when he ends the war in Ukraine and possibly in Gaza too.",

They just don't follow the ideology you'd want them to. \"They like Putin\" is a long way from \"they don't alling with the EU and USA\".\n\nAlso, don't expect the same people who caused this issue to solve this problem as you are saying.\n\nAnd immigration is a big problem when you welcome people with a different cultural background than the ones already existing peacefully in your country. You had Christians and atheists. You welcomed muslims who want to bring Sharia law with them. They also make many children and ensure they also become muslims. So far, the previous government not only made the crime rate kncrease but also endangered the future of Sweeden because the muslims who want Sharia law for everyone will eventually become the majority. At that point Sweeden will become like the nations these people fled from in the first place.\n\nAnd Milei is not facing the same isues as Sweeden. Argentina is economically endangered, not culturally threatened by a horde of muslim immigrants. You are literally comparing apples to tomatoes.\n\nThough, I agree Javier Milei may, in fact, be the best leader in the world at this point. Maybe Trump will surpass him in 2024 when he ends the war in Ukraine and possibly in Gaza too.",

Just look at the UK where nothing has changed and mass immigration from the EU (1.3 million Poles, 1 million Romanians etc) has been replaced with 700k from outside of the EU in just one year.  Most are low paid, low skilled, contribute nothing in tax but are totally reliant on the welfare state.  Zero increase in infrastructure (housing, transport, education, healthcare) for the millions who keep arriving. How can that be sustainable!?",

This goes beyond any one political party this is both political parties. This is something that Congress needs to fix. They're going to push the blame off on the president but the president's only around for at most 8 years. If you add both of terms together. Those 100 or so Representatives as they call them can be around for as long as they want to be. As long as they have support. They get reelected some of them stay in their 30 and 40 years. They are the true problem. Think about it all they have to is wait till after the president leaves office and push through any agenda they want if that particular president is blocking them. They set this entire thing up.",

That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always worked since like the beginning of human history..\n\nMexicans have a lot of Spanish (aka European) ancestry so anyone who is trying to say America ‚Äústole it‚Äù from Mexico needs to then say Mexico stole it from the indigenous. And the Spanish were a lot less friendly to them & their own colonists. \n\nThat said, I don‚Äôt think most people in developed countries focus on history or dwell on the past that much (with a few exceptions). I‚Äôve noticed in some countries they do a lot. To me that indicates they must not have a lot going for them, to dwell on things that happened decades or even hundreds of years ago. They are stuck so much in the past rather than focusing on the present or building a better future.",
